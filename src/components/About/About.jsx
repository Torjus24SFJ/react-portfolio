              I&#39;m passionate about creating websites that not only look
              great but also feel great to use. I enjoy designing in Figma,
              planning out how everything should function, and then bringing it
              to life through code. I take inspiration from other developers but
              always aim to put my own spin on it, experimenting to find what
              works best. For me, a great website is more than just visualsâ€”it
              should be smooth, intuitive, and satisfying to interact with. I
              focus on the details, from snappy animations to thoughtful UI
              elements, ensuring that every part of the experience feels
              intentional.
